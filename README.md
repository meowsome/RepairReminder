# RepairReminder

Plugin for the Nogard Minecraft server.

If player has permissions, the plugin will prevent tools from breaking when the tool is at lowest durability. When this happens, the tool can no longer break blocks and a message is displayed telling the user to run the fix command and how many levels it will take.

If the player doesn't have permissions, tools break normally.

Permissions:
